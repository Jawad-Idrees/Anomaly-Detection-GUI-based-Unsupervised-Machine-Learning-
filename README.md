# Anomaly-Detection-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning-
Here, I have built an Unsupervised Machine Learning Model for Anomaly Detection. The model uses density-based Anoamly Detection which is widely used and highly reliable technique for the job. I have implemented my own algorithm for the Anomaly Detection which has been thoroughly explained in the pdf document attached with the project.
